# x402 Payment Gateway — Example Configuration
#
# Copy this file to x402.toml and customise for your operator deployment.
# The gateway converts wei-denominated job prices into stablecoin amounts
# using the exchange rates and markups defined here.

# Socket address for the x402 HTTP server.
bind_address = "0.0.0.0:8402"

# URL of the x402 facilitator used for payment verification and settlement.
facilitator_url = "https://x402.org/facilitator"

# How long (seconds) dynamically-generated quotes stay valid.
quote_ttl_secs = 300

# Service instance ID (set at runtime by the operator).
service_id = 1

# ─── Accepted Tokens ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Each [[accepted_tokens]] entry describes a token the operator will accept.
# Fields:
#   network             – CAIP-2 chain identifier (e.g. "eip155:8453" for Base)
#   asset               – Token contract address on that chain
#   symbol              – Human-readable symbol
#   decimals            – Token decimal places (6 for USDC, 18 for DAI, etc.)
#   pay_to              – Operator's receive address on this chain
#   rate_per_native_unit – Exchange rate: 1 native unit = N token units
#   markup_bps          – Markup in basis points (100 bps = 1%)

# USDC on Base
