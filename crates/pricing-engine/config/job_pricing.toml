# Per-job pricing configuration
#
# Controls GetJobPrice RFQ quotes. Each section is a service ID.
# Keys are job indices, values are prices in wei (strings for large numbers).
#
# When a consumer calls GetJobPrice(service_id, job_index), the engine
# looks up the price here and returns a signed EIP-712 quote.
# If no entry exists, the RPC returns NOT_FOUND.
