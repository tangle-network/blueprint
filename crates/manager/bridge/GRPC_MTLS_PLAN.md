# gRPC + mTLS Bridge Integration Plan

## Objective
Deliver end-to-end support for configuring gRPC services that require TLS termination and optional client mTLS through the Blueprint → Bridge → Manager pipeline. The current bridge always persists `ServiceModel { tls_profile: None }`, so mTLS can never be enabled even though the downstream proxy stack supports it. This plan closes that gap.

## Scope & Assumptions
- Scope covers `crates/manager/bridge`, the protobuf contract it exposes, and the immediate call sites in Blueprint that invoke the bridge client. Downstream consumers (`crates/auth`) already understand `TlsProfile` and gRPC detection.
- Changes must remain backward compatible for old clients until they are recompiled; proto additions should therefore use optional/repeated fields only.
- TLS assets sent over the bridge must already be encrypted with the manager’s envelope. The bridge should treat them as opaque bytes and not attempt local encryption.
- The plan assumes the Blueprint runtime can surface the necessary TLS blobs (or fetch them) prior to calling the bridge. If that is not yet true, note the dependency and coordinate with the owning team.

## Workstream A – Protobuf & API Surface
1. **Model the TLS payloads.**
   - Add a `TlsProfileConfig` message in `proto/bridge.proto` mirroring the fields of `blueprint_auth::models::TlsProfile` (all byte fields stay as `bytes`).
   - Include nested helpers (e.g., `ClientCertificateBundle`) only if it improves clarity; otherwise keep a single flat message for parity with the Rust struct.
2. **Extend register request.**
   - Add an optional `TlsProfileConfig tls_profile = 5;` to `RegisterBlueprintServiceProxyRequest`.
   - Document in proto comments that fields are expected to be envelope-encrypted.
3. **Add an explicit update RPC (optional but recommended).**
   - Define `UpdateBlueprintServiceTlsProfileRequest` (service_id + optional profile fields) and corresponding RPC to mutate TLS settings after initial registration. Mark in comments whether sending an empty profile clears TLS.
   - Decide whether deletes should be handled via `google.protobuf.Empty` or explicit boolean flags.
4. **Re-run code generation.**
   - Update `build.rs` if additional proto imports are required. Re-run `tonic_build` to regenerate `src/api.rs`.
   - Ensure generated code lands under the existing `blueprint_manager_bridge` module with new request/response types.

## Workstream B – Bridge Client API
1. **Design Rust-side config struct.**
   - Introduce a new public helper (e.g., `TlsProfileConfig` or reuse `blueprint_auth::models::TlsProfile`) behind the `client` feature. Provide conversion functions to the protobuf type.
2. **Update registration call signature.**
   - Extend `Bridge::register_blueprint_service_proxy` in `src/client.rs` to accept an `Option<TlsProfileConfig>`.
   - Convert owners as before; map the provided TLS profile to the protobuf message when present.
   - Ensure the method remains source-compatible by introducing a builder-style method or by adding a new method (`register_blueprint_service_proxy_with_tls`) and marking the old signature as deprecated until all callers migrate.
3. **Surface update call.**
   - Add a new async method that forwards the `UpdateBlueprintServiceTlsProfileRequest` RPC. Include doc comments about expected encryption and lifecycle (e.g., call after certificate rotation).
4. **Handle gRPC awareness (no change required).**
   - Confirm that no additional client configuration is needed for gRPC detection; note this explicitly for implementers so they do not chase unnecessary work.

## Workstream C – Bridge Server Logic
1. **Populate TLS profile on register.**
   - In `src/server.rs`, when building `ServiceModel`, convert the optional `TlsProfileConfig` to `blueprint_auth::models::TlsProfile` before persisting. Replace the hard-coded `tls_profile: None` with this value.
   - Validate that required fields (e.g., `tls_enabled`, certificate bundles) are present when `tls_enabled` is true; respond with `Status::invalid_argument` if not.
2. **Implement update RPC.**
   - Load the existing `ServiceModel`, merge or replace the `tls_profile` based on request semantics, persist, and return an empty response.
   - Emit structured logs for both success and failure paths.
3. **Clean shutdown semantics.**
   - Ensure error handling continues to surface gRPC status codes correctly, especially since TLS profile validation may introduce new failure cases.

## Workstream D – Blueprint Callers & Configuration
1. **Blueprint runtime plumbing (follow-up in blueprint crate).**
   - Update whichever component currently calls `Bridge::register_blueprint_service_proxy` to pass the TLS profile data collected from configuration files or runtime inputs.
   - If TLS assets need to be encrypted, integrate with the manager-provided envelope before invoking the bridge.
2. **Document required configuration fields.**
   - Update Blueprint configuration schemas or manifests to include TLS-related keys (e.g., server cert/key, client CA bundle, mTLS toggle, SAN template).
   - Clearly state which fields are mandatory for gRPC + mTLS and how to rotate certificates.

## Workstream E – Testing & Validation
1. **Unit tests.**
   - Add tests in `crates/manager/bridge` that round-trip a `TlsProfileConfig` through the client/server conversion.
   - Include negative tests validating that incomplete TLS profiles are rejected.
2. **Integration tests.**
   - Extend or add an integration test (potentially in `crates/auth/src/tests/grpc_proxy_tests.rs`) that registers a service with TLS enabled, enforces mTLS, and executes a gRPC call through the proxy.
   - Add a scenario exercising the update RPC to rotate certificates and confirm the proxy picks up the change.
3. **Backward compatibility check.**
   - Verify that an older blueprint binary (without TLS fields) still registers successfully against the updated bridge server (the new fields are optional).
4. **Security review.**
   - Have security reviewers confirm that TLS materials remain encrypted at rest/in transit and that no logs leak secret data.

## Workstream F – Documentation & Rollout
1. **Developer docs.**
   - Add a README section or ADR under `docs/` explaining the new TLS workflow, required configuration, and how to use the update RPC.
2. **Release notes.**
   - Prepare a changelog entry (crate-level `CHANGELOG.md`) describing the new optional proto fields and RPC, plus migration guidance.
3. **Versioning.**
   - Bump the bridge crate version (and any dependent crates) following semver rules. Publish updated proto definitions if shared externally.
4. **Deployment checklist.**
   - Coordinate rollout so the manager/bridge server is updated before blueprints relying on TLS; otherwise new clients will receive `UNIMPLEMENTED` responses.

## Open Questions To Resolve Early
- Where do blueprints obtain envelope-encrypted TLS blobs? If additional API support is required (e.g., fetching an encryption key), plan a parallel workstream.
- Do we need partial updates (e.g., rotate only the upstream client cert) or will updates always send a full profile? Clarify to avoid schema churn later.
- Should clearing TLS be explicit (dedicated flag) instead of interpreting an empty profile as “disable TLS”? Decide before finalizing the proto to prevent ambiguous behavior.

## API Usage Examples

### Service Registration with TLS

```rust
use blueprint_auth::models::TlsProfile;

// Create a TLS profile for server-only TLS
let tls_profile = TlsProfile {
    tls_enabled: true,
    require_client_mtls: false,
    encrypted_server_cert: encrypted_server_cert_bytes,
    encrypted_server_key: encrypted_server_key_bytes,
    // ... other fields as needed
};

// Register service with TLS profile
bridge.register_blueprint_service_proxy(
    service_id,
    Some("api_key_prefix"),
    "https://upstream-service:8080",
    &owners,
    Some(tls_profile),
).await?;
```

### Service Registration with mTLS

```rust
// Create a TLS profile requiring client mTLS
let tls_profile = TlsProfile {
    tls_enabled: true,
    require_client_mtls: true,
    encrypted_server_cert: encrypted_server_cert_bytes,
    encrypted_server_key: encrypted_server_key_bytes,
    encrypted_client_ca_bundle: encrypted_client_ca_bytes,
    client_cert_ttl_hours: 24,
    sni: Some("api.example.com".to_string()),
    allowed_dns_names: vec!["api.example.com".to_string()],
    // ... other fields as needed
};

// Register service with mTLS
bridge.register_blueprint_service_proxy(
    service_id,
    Some("api_key_prefix"),
    "https://upstream-service:8080",
    &owners,
    Some(tls_profile),
).await?;
```

### Updating TLS Profile

```rust
// Update TLS profile after service registration
bridge.update_blueprint_service_tls_profile(
    service_id,
    Some(updated_tls_profile),
).await?;

// Disable TLS for a service
bridge.update_blueprint_service_tls_profile(
    service_id,
    None,
).await?;
```

### Migration from Legacy Registration

```rust
// Legacy registration (still supported)
bridge.register_blueprint_service_proxy(
    service_id,
    Some("api_key_prefix"),
    "https://upstream-service:8080",
    &owners,
