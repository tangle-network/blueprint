# Blueprint SDK - Audit Rules

FOCUS:
- Rust API design and ergonomics
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation completeness
- Public API stability
- No breaking changes without version bump

IGNORE:
- **/target/**
- **/*.test.rs
- **/examples/**

STRICT:
- Any unwrap() in library code
- Missing doc comments on public items
- Unsafe without safety comments
- Breaking API changes

CONTEXT:
Blueprint SDK for building AVS (Actively Validated Services).
Public Rust library used by external developers.
API stability and documentation are critical.
